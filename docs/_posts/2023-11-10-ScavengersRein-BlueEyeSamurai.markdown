Yesterday three new (and final of season one) episodes of Scavenger's Rein came about. I have to say I think it could be my favorite animated series ever. All the characters are believable, with flaws and depth, and arcs that take different twists and turns, or peter out.

 I was talking to my cousin about the episodes and I pitched my theory to her. Spoilers ahead if you haven't see episodes 10, 11, and 12. My theory revolves around the little Levi and the very end of episode 12.
 
  At the very end of the episode some masked men find kris stranded in her ship. The ship is overgrown with lichen, and Kris can be heard begging for water as the mask men make their way through the ship. When they finally reach Kris they hear some scurrying and look to see a tiny Levi. One of the masked men turns their staff of light toward the little Levi. Small Levi come out from behind the threshold where it was standing, and points at the light just like the little guy from the wall did when Ursula stopped. This scene made me think back to earlier in the episode when Levi "devolves" the telekinetic panda. During that scene we see a "flash back" to the formation of the world. This makes me think that the lichen that is making Levi aware, is the very essence of the world.

  I Finished Blue Eye Samurai this morning over breakfast. I really liked it, but some of it is a little eye rolly. Not in an entirely bad was a lot of it is fun. Its defiantly one of the best shows I've seen out of Netflix in a while, it's quite good. I'm looking forward to the next season.

  That concludes my reflection on the new animated shows. These western animations are really good, and I hope they keep making more.
